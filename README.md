# Scanner
Code for a Lego Mindstorms scanner, written in RobotC

Scanner custom-built out of LEGO components
Scans and displays a black and white image on the LEGO NXT brick's 100 x 64 pixel display
Displays in 3 "resolutions" or sizes - low, medium, and high
Some values are hard-coded due to the sensor used (other sensors may need to be calibrated differently)
